WebArcadium

WebArcadium is a brand new web arcade which focuses on a clean attractive user interface and enjoyable experience! The intention of this application is to show the abilities that I have gained over the past twelve weeks as a student in the Web Development Immersive Class taught by General Assembly. Another goal is to have a really solid logic base for the making of the games, and a fully functional bug free application.



User Stories:

-As a user I want to be able to play two (maybe three) browser based arcade games.

-As a user I want to have a very attractive User Interface using Bootstrap or Foundation.

-As a user I want the games to utilize WebSockets.

-As a user I want the application to track how many times I’ve won/lost.

-As a user I want to be able to try and break the program and not be able to succeed. 



Wireframe Ideas:

- I want the interface to be attractive in a minimalist type of way. I guess I’m picturing lots of solid light colors(i.e.- silver and white). One idea I have is for the tic-tac-toe bored to have “+” signs over the playable squares. Once the player selects a square the “+” sign changes to the players symbol (“X” or “O”). I want the edges of all the buttons to be rounded. Also, I really want the landing page to be very enjoyable to look at. The user should instantly know upon visiting the application that it looks good. 

Entity Relationship Diagram:
-I’m not really sure how much Object Oriented Programming will go into this project seeing as the application revolves around a series of games to be played in the browser. Maybe for scoring and tracking a players wins over time but besides that I don’t really see anywhere that an ERD is necessary. I’m going to create tic-tac-toe today and then maybe an ERD will become more clear.
